This project focuses on developing a library to implement search engines. The core of the project is built using C++, with additional components in Python and Cython for flexibility and performance. The library builds an inverted index to store and retrieve data efficiently. It utilizes ranking algorithms, such as PageRank, to prioritize results based on keyword relevance and page importance, providing fast and reliable search outcomes.

The goal of the project is to create a reusable and adaptable tool that can be integrated into various search engines to improve indexing and ranking processes. By focusing on performance and scalability, the library aims to handle large datasets and provide accurate search results in real-time.
